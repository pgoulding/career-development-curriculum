### Setting New Norms
Welcome to Module 4. It's easy to feel burnt out at this point in the program; however, this module is your peak. It's the opportunity to refine your technical and professional skills for the job search. The best way to do that is to support each other through this module as a cohesive cohort.

You’ve worked together for 3 mods already, and you’ve set norms for how to work together. Now you’re transitioning into not only working together but preparing for your careers post-Turing. To set us up for success this module, let's start with setting some new norms on how we can best work and support each other. 

#### Whole Group Discussion
Cold call 3 people to answer one of each of these questions:

* What does your cohort do well? How do you know? 
* How would you describe the morale of your cohort? What contributes to that?
* How would you describe your cohort's successes so far? What contributes to that?

Consider your cohort's strengths and how you can capitalize on them this module. 

#### Individual Reflections
Reflect on these questions in your journals to prepare for discussions with your cohorts:

* How can you do your best work this module?
* What role do you want to take within your cohort to ensure everyone can do their best work?
* What will success look like for you at the end of this module? What will success look like for your cohort?

#### Cohort Discussions
Divide the room down the middle with BE on one side and FE on the other (note: if cohorts are especially large, this could be done in small groups or in each of the cohort's respective classrooms before coming back to Clarke to share out). Each cohort will have a chart paper to contribute group norms to, which must include these particular sections: 

* Definition of success for the cohort this module
* Goals for how to make Mod 4 your "peak" and what steps you will take as a cohort to achieve that
* Norms for the roles cohortmates will take (and won't take) this module

One person should be the notetaker, and everyone should be given an opportunity to participate. 

### Share Out
* One representative from each group will share out the cohort's norms as well as additional volunteers to share about their individual roles in the cohort. 

Now that we know our cohort norms for Mod 4, let's discuss options for Mod 4 PD.

### Mod 4 PD Options
While you will still receive a few whole group PD sessions, in weeks 3-5, you can choose to participate in small group job search mentorship with a staff member. 

Please read over this [1-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsPZtNaDBTNvFUcoVwGVYPLGg7wQtNqJUKix0XS88Xs/edit?usp=sharing) with information on what this means as well as the [application requirements for job search mentorship](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/job_search_mentorship_application.md). Discuss questions from the whole group.

Reminders about Huntr:
* Make sure you've installed the Chrome plugin so adding positions is seamless from the posting site
* Update this regularly throughout each stage of the process

### Cover Letter Review
Cold calling of the whole group:

* 1. Why do we write cover letters?
* 2. That being said, what should be in a cover letter? What shouldn't be in a cover letter?
* 3. What are elements of a strong cover letter?

Reminder that a cover letter should:

* Provide your introduction
* Create a connection between you and the job/company
* Provide insight into how you would do this work

#### Individual Review
* Read through your cover letter and write down specific questions you have about it
* Compare your cover letter to the norms of the [cover letter checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md)
* Highlight how many times you say "I" versus the name of the company

#### Small Group Review
Break out into groups of 3-4 people and in a group DM, send your cover letter drafts. Each person will give a brief summary about the company and the position and then will read their cover letter aloud. Within the group, each person should take on a specific role:

* Partner 1: Critique tone & sentence structure
    * How did you feel about the reader after hearing the letter? What impression did you have of them and why?
    * How many of the sentences start with "I"? Is there variety in the sentences?
    * What are you confused about?
* Partner 2: Critique content
    * What do you know about this person's qualifications from what you heard in the letter?
    * How will the applicant contribute to the company?
    * What are some ways that the applicant could make these connections stronger?
* (If applicable) Partner 3: Go through the checklist to make sure nothing's missing

#### Revision Time
Take 5 minutes to work on revisions to your letter.

### Closing
* Reminder of your norms for the module
* Reminder about application process for job search mentorship
* Next week: cover letter workshop
  * Revise your cover letter or write a new one using what you've learned today and be prepared to participate in the workshop
