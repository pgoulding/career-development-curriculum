* Opening: 5 mins
* Review & Strategy: 10 mins
* Whole Group Practice: 20 mins
* Debrief: 5 mins
* Partner Work Time: 15 mins
* Next Steps & Closing: 5 mins

#### Objectives
* Understand the role of outreach within your job search 
* Review and execute outreach strategies
* Identify how you will move forward with at least one contact for your own job search

### Opening
Last mod, we discussed utilizing outreach for research to use in your job search by setting up meetings with warm outreach contacts. Now we'll start to discuss how to use the same outreach principles and apply them to reaching out to people at the companies with open positions that you want. 

#### Whole Group Share Out
* Who executed their outreach plan from last mod? Share out results
* Who didn't? Why not -- what held you back?

### Review
What is our strategy for job searching? When we find a position want to apply for, we also need to find someone to reach out to.

#### The Why
Now that you're researching companies and positions, why reach out to someone from that company?

* Research 
  * Incorporate into your cover letter and interviews
* Connecting with a person
  * Building relationships
  * Exchanging information (mutual benefits)
  * Expanding both of your networks
* Become a referral candidate

#### The Who
Who should you reach out to from a company?

* Any warm contacts
* Software developers
  * Juniors vs. seniors
  * Engineering managers
* Recruiters
* Where do you find them?
  * Company page
  * LinkedIn

#### The What
Start with Research

Then, what do you say in your message?

* Introduction (who are you?)
* Purpose/Connection (why are you reaching out?)
* Specifics (what do you know about the contact? What do you know about the company?)
* Questions (what do you want to know?)

Do not:

* Ask for referrals without establishing relationships
* Ask for a job
* Send a LinkedIn request with no introduction
* Use a generic template that hasn't been customized

#### How to Send the Message: Email vs. LinkedIn
Whenever possible, find your contact's email (or use Slack if they're in the Turing network!). Why? Unless you're actively job searching or actively hiring, people may not be checking their LinkedIn regularly and might miss your message. Also, LinkedIn messages have a limited number of characters you can use. Instead try some of the following tools to find your contact's email:

* Tools for finding emails:
  * [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
  * [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
  * [Find That Email](https://findthat.email/)
  * [MatterMark](https://mattermark.com/)
  * [Skrapp.io](https://www.skrapp.io/)
  * [Quickmail.io](https://quickmail.io/)
  * [Snov.io](https://snov.io/)
  * [Go Pin Leads](https://www.gopinleads.com/)
  * GitHub
  * Personal website 

### Whole Group Practice
Let's have 2 volunteers to walk us through this process:

* Find a posting.
* Find 1 person at the company to reach out to. 
* How can we do research on them? What do we say in the message? 
* How do we contact them?

#### Whole Group Debrief
* What should you keep in mind when executing outreach tied to a job posting?

### Partner Practice
With a partner, using 1 position you posted to your Huntr board last week:

* Find and research a contact
* Find their contact information
* Draft a message to them

### Follow-Through: Coffee Meetings
* Prep your story
* Prep questions to ask
* Use your research
* What do you want to know about the company? The role? 
* [Look at this question list](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/non-technical/questions-to-ask.md)

#### You Do
Using positions you added to Huntr last week, research a contact, find their contact information, and draft a message to them.

### Closing
What's next? Coffee Meetings!
* Prep your story
* Prep questions to ask

Next week, you'll be going on **Job Shadowing**. We know that this is *not* a job interview, but it is an opportunity to create connections with others in the industry. Add contact information and other info to your Jobtrack from your Job Shadowing experience. 

Here are other expectations:

* Keep your phones off/out of reach 
* Don't drink alcohol prior to the shadow
* Dress professionally -- doesn't need to be overly dressy, focus on business casual
* Come prepared with questions

For further preparation, please read this feedback from an alum at Ibotta who participated in the employer side of job shadowing: 
```As a Turing grad who benefitted greatly from shadowing, it's a pleasure to be able to hopefully provide the same benefit to Turing students who shadow me at Ibotta. I have a bit of feedback for future shadowing students: It's best not to consume anything before the shadowing that might cause one's breath to smell like alcohol. If it's not alcohol, then sometimes chewing tobacco can cause this odor. When you're sitting right next to someone you're shadowing, they will smell it. So that's something Turing students might want to be aware of before they shadow. Another thing is that it's best not to check your phone while the person you're shadowing is trying to show you things. It's rude and shows that you're unengaged during time that the person has taken out of their day to hopefully show you useful stuff. Another thing I'd recommend is for students to come prepared with questions. This is a rare opportunity to learn what life is like outside of Turing, and it's a shame to not take advantage of it. Respectfully asking questions also evidences engagement and interest on the part of the student. I am so glad that Turing offers its students this opportunity, and it was something that I found really useful.```
