### Do's & Don't's of a Cover Letter
**Whole Group Discussion:** What is the purpose of a cover letter?

In a cover letter, you should: 

* Demonstrate an understanding of the company
* Introduce yourself...by talking about them
   * What is it that you do that could contribute to what the company does?
   * How would you provide value?
* Create a connection between you and the company
   * What can we do together?
   * It’s not about what you can *get*; it’s about what you can *give*

Here are some things to keep in mind when writing a cover letter:

* There are multiple ways to write an effective cover letter
* The important part is that it’s customized to the company each time
* General rules to follow:
   * Any time you mention yourself connect it explicitly to the job/company
   * Keep it concise (no more than a page; half a page is ideal)
   * If you’ve met someone at the company, drop their name!
   * State the position you’re applying for in the first line
   
### How to Incorporate Your Story: The Elevator Pitch
* Merging my background in X and Y, I help (industry) improve (outcomes).
   * “Merging my background in entrepreneurship and graphic design, I help technology companies improve user engagement and retention with UX Design.”

* Break into parts:
1. Here’s what I did in the previous phase of my career + What I learned…
2. And here’s what I can do for you based on what I’ve learned...
   
### Examples
In groups, discuss these cover letters as though you're a hiring manager:

* What do you notice about these cover letters?
* What is effective? What value could they bring to the company? How do you know?
* What could be changed to make the letter more effective?

#### Frequently Made Mistakes in Cover Letters

**Mistake:** Very long/wordy cover letters. **Solution:** Shorter paragraphs to be easily skimmable; Cut out extraneous details 

**Mistake:** Cover letter is all about you. **Solution:** Only talk about yourself in the context of this job and company to demonstrate how you will provide value. Don’t talk about what you’re hoping to **get** from the company (i.e., mentorship, culture, etc.). The letter should be all about what you’re going to **give** the company as an employee.

**Mistake:** Grammar and spelling errors. **Solution:** Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or the [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### We Do
As a whole group, let's look at a job posting and decide what we'd put in a cover letter for it. We'll discuss:

* What do we notice in the job description that stands out to us? 
* What can we pull out to discuss in the cover letter?
* What research should we do?
* How can we use our professional story here?

### Workshop Time
Form groups of 2-3 people in your program and draft out a cover letter for a position you find as a group.

Remember:

* Use research
* Create relevant connections
* How will you provide value? 

### Round of Feedback: Pair & Share
Team up with a group not in your program to share your cover letters and give each other feedback. Feedback should be **specific, actionable, and kind** and include both **appreciation and coaching.** 

### Work Time
Using a position you've added to Huntr, work on a cover letter today using the principles we've discussed. 

### Closing
Debrief as a whole group:

* What are your next steps/takeaways from today's session?

Reminder about deliverables:

* Cover letter draft for a real position due week 1 of Mod 4
  * Reminder you can find job postings from [the sites listed here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies.md). Remember to note any research you need to do and add it to your Huntr boards.
