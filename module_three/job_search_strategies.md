### Opening
#### Objectives

* Understand all components that go into an effective job search

* Start a list of companies and jobs to research

The traditional way to look for jobs isn't necessarily the best route. 

Applying for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. As little as [20-30% of job listings](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking) are being posted online. That means that when you're _only_ looking at company job postings, you are decreasing your chances of finding a job significantly. 

In contrast, [referral candidates](http://www.careerxroads.com/news/SourcesOfHire2013.pdf) are 3-4 times more likely to be hired than non-referral candidates. To add yourself to those numbers, today we'll talk about how to find a job without relying on just a job application. 

#### Group Discussion
Form groups of 3-4 people, grab a piece of chart paper, and create a list to answer this question:

* What are all the things you should do for a successful job search as a junior developer? 

After 5 minutes of brainstorming, walk around the room to read other groups’ papers:
* What trends do you see?
* What is something new you hadn’t thought of?
* What will be challenging for you to do in the job search?

As a group, we'll come up with a definitive list.

Now that you have an idea of what you'll need to do, how can you keep track of these things?

### Prep for Your Job Search: Using a Tracker
The first step to a successful job search is to utilize a tracking system. Having a system to keep track of everything from companies you're interested in to notes from coffee meetings will be highly beneficial in staying organized in the job search. We'll get set up today using [Huntr](https://huntr.co/):

* Start by reading through this guide to [using Huntr here](https://help.huntr.co/for-job-seekers/huntr-quickstart-guide)
* Install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/huntr-job-search-tracker/mihdfbecejheednfigjpdacgeilhlmnf)
* Start customizing your board!

### The Process
So if you aren't going to just apply to a posting on a job board, what is your process?

Here are helpful tips for the process:
1. Find a job posting that interests you
  * Use one of the job searching tools below
2. Conduct research
  * Go to the company's site and find out about their mission, product, customer base, blog posts
  * Conduct a Google search on articles or other information about the company
  * If the company has any open source projects on GitHub, check them out
  * Find people who work at the company using LinkedIn
3. Do some cold outreach
  * Who do you reach out to?
    * Developers: Both juniors and seniors will be helpful to talk to and find out information about the company, what it's like to work there, and what to expect in the interview process
    * Use LinkedIn to see if you have any mutual connections who can make an introduction
  * Set up a coffee meeting or phone call
    * Ask questions! Gather information to use in your cover letter and resume
4. Complete the Application
  * Customize your resume for the position
  * Write a tailored cover letter
  * Mention the contact you met
5. Go back to your Contact
  * Let them know you've applied

Update Huntr in every step of the process.

#### The Essential Step in the Process: Building Your Network & Conducting Outreach
In addition to finding the right posting, remember that the next step is to find a face at the company to connect with. LinkedIn will be your go-to site for this, but a great way to continue the research into places you want to work that are aligned with your goals is by building your network. Below are some suggestions for groups to utilize for this purpose:

* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/)
   * Tips: Search for groups local to the area you’re interested in working and in topics that you're interested in pursuing (i.e. Ruby, JavaScript, etc.). Be sure to select "Groups" (not "Calendar"). On the group page, there are two things that will be very useful to your job search:
      * Organizers list: who are they? Where do they work? What other meetups are they active in?
      * Upcoming events: look at the RSVP list; Who else is going? What companies do they work for? 
* [BeVisible](https://www.bevisible.soy/) is a career network for Latinx.

* [MAES](http://mymaes.org/) was founded in Los Angeles in 1974 to increase the number of Mexican Americans and other Hispanics in the technical and scientific fields. 
* [National Society of Black Engineers](http://www.nsbe.org/home.aspx) is one of the largest student-governed organizations with the aim to increase the number of culturally responsible Black Engineers.

### Demo: Group Practice
As a whole group, we'll find a job listing to go through. Using this job listing, I'm going to update my Huntr and create a plan for outreach using the guidelines we discussed last module in the [Outreach & Networking Session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_and_networking.md):

* Update my contacts -- how do I find contact information?
* Craft my email -- what should I say? 
* Create a task/Set up a meeting
