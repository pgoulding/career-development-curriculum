# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 
Waterfall is typically used by the larger company's and can be quite innefective when it comes to projects as it is usually a large scope document that has many dependencies up the chain. Agile can be used with smaller teams when you have more direct input/feedback from the customer or design/UX team.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

We used waffle.io, some driver-navigator, and code reviews whenever someone would push up a new function.

3. What role did you take on in the project? 
I built a few little functions, but I was the most novice skill level mostly backseat the other two would give me a code review whenever they were done with a function.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
I would have us meet and take turns building each function and explaining what it does and how it works, rather than letting one person do most of the work and then trying to fuigure out what they have done.

5. How does retro function in a team project?
Its used to give feedback on how everyone did and worked togewther as well as give suggestions to help improve the other people in teams for the future.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

I went home sick with a fever on the day we had team Retro, so my partners just did it together.

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?

I don't have great feedback skills and sometimes I just stay quiet and let the other person talk. I would like to become more vocal with when something bothers me or what expectations I have, but at this point my confidence is shot and I don't know how to assert myself when I think I might be the dumbest person in the room.
