# Storytelling Reflection 

1. Describe your 3-act arc by answering these three questions in 1-2 paragraphs: 
* **Who are you?** Consider describing:
  * How your values and perspective have driven you to come to Turing
  * Your Pairin themes
  * How you've seen yourself grow during this module at Turing 

I am a 28 year old Veteran of the United States Air Force, as such I have been in a lot of stressful situations with urgent deadlines. I'm also very much an internal processor and I tend to want to try and figure out everything by myself which can put me in a position of falling behind or unfortunately having people think I don't like them or I'm a loner. It's not that I don't enjoy teams, but if I'm the weakest on a subject I don't like to burden others with dragging me along. Currently I'm trying to change my mindset into more of a growth mindset of "I can do this, I just might need a little more time(esepecially  if I always work it out alone.)" rather than a fixed mindset of "I can't do this, I'm not smart enough, they should just go on without me."

* **Why are you here?** Consider describing:
  * When have you struggled at Turing? How have you dealt with struggle? 
  * When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

I came to Turing to gain a mastery in something that has interested me for a long time but I never had a formal class in and had always felt like that held me back from achieving everything that I want to do. Sometime at Turing it seems like you are trying to drink water from a firehose when learning a new idea or subject but I understand that high expectations drive high results. I have struggled at times when trying to understand new topics, but whenever I get to a real low point I look back a week or two and think about how far I've come. Yes, sometimes I might feel like I'm behind, but I don't know everyones personal struggles and maybe I shouldn't be so hard on myself.

* **What's next?** Consider describing:
  * Your vision statement for what you see as your place in the tech industry and how your journey into this new career ends
  
  *Cut to 5 years from now* I'm head of a small but thriving company with 20+ employees. My phone rings, its Jeff Bezos, he wants to buy my company for 10 billion, I laugh and say "I told you once, I'll tell you a hundred times Jeffy, I'm not selling" we then laugh together and go grab a drink on his private floating sky island. My dog is there, life is good.
  I figure its good to keep your dreams realistic.
  
2. After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?

Wasn't that difficult to do sto, I just start stream of conciousness writing and it spills out onto the page. It's probably not good writing, but thats how I've always done it.
