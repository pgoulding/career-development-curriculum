# PD & Gear Up Plan for Repeating Module One
Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search. Mod 1 professional development is focused on these areas:

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
* Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
* Ownership over one's learning
* Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
* Express one's own story and strengths
* Manage stress effectively

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

Here's the breakdown of expectations for repeating the module:

### Sessions
You **are not required** to attend the following professional development sessions (you can choose to come to sessions if you feel that you would benefit from the information):
   * Week 1: [Building a Foundation for your Career Development](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/building_a_foundation.md) 
   * Week 2: [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md) 
   * Week 3: [Feedback I](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/feedback_i.md)
   * Week 5: [Storytelling I](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/storytelling_i.md)

You **are required** to attend all Gear Up sessions as well as the group participation portions of the week 4 sessions since that will involve your current project groups:
   * [Agile Practices & Leadership](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/agile_practices_and_leadership.md)
   * [Feedback II & Team Retro](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/module_one)
    
### Deliverables
* You **are required** to:
   * Participate in DTR and in crafting a DTR memo with your paired project partner
   * Submit feedback for your paired project partner
   * Participate in a team project retro
   * Complete any PD deliverables that you did not complete last module

* Options for additional deliverables (choose **at least 1** that you will complete during the module):
   * Identify an area of growth for yourself this module. Examples: organization, project management, time management, stress management, communication, etc. Create a goal for how you would like to improve this area and outline action steps to take. You can also discuss any of these areas with Allison if you would like to set up a 1:1 coaching session.
   * Brainstorm a way you will contribute to helping your cohort build community and describe steps you will take to build to see it through. Examples: organize a study group, lead a review session for the class, assist your SAB reps (if you are not one) in facilitating your cohort retros, organize a non-coding social activity, etc.
   * Research and implement a new project management tool in your team project.
   * Take on the project manager role in your team project. 
   * Write a blog post about something you've learned
   * Attend a Meetup *(be specific on which meetup in your plan below)*
   * Give an additional Lightning Talk, either at Wrap Up or during non-class time for your cohort
   * Other: propose another professional development action step that you will take during your repeat module

### Outline of Your PD & Gear Up Plan:
**Directions:** Write your answers to the questions below in a secret gist that you'll submit to Allison. Outline your goal that you've chosen by creating a [SMART goal](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals). 

#### Goal (what is the goal): 

* Specific (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?): 

* Measurable (How can you measure progress and know if youâ€™ve successfully met your goal?):

* Achievable (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?):

* Relevant (How does this goal connect to your larger career goals?):

* Timebound (When do you plan to achieve this goal by? Be specific and consider how realistic your expectations are):

* Would you like to set up coaching with Allison to help you with your goals and accountability? If so, please [fill out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/Z57ywysDRqhOKfHD2)

**Allison will review all plans, and you will be asked to fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/yY8pd8bcJGV3bPwq2) giving a brief update and reflection on your goals by 9am on Monday of Week 6.**
