### Opening
**Turn & Talk:** Last mod, you were asked to write a job description for yourself as a software developer:
* What are some of the ways you see yourself excelling as a software developer?
* What excites you most right now about this career?

Today we'll talk about the steps you can take to make sure that you continue building those feelings of excitement and passion in your new career as a software developer. After all, you're making this career transition because you weren't happy in your last job -- let's make sure that your happiness is front and center in your new career. 

This relates directly to our mission at Turing as we strive for all students to **succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.**

We'll utilize a job-hunting strategy from [What Color is Your Parachute](http://www.jobhuntersbible.com/) by Richard N. Bolles to unpack your values, goals, and passions to make this job search your most successful and satisfying. 

### Learning Objectives:

* Describe yourself in 7 different ways to enhance your professional story
* Outline specific priorities for your job search 
* Describe in detail the kind of career you’re looking for

## Recommended Deliverable:
**[Complete the Flower Exercise 1-pager](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf)** and share it with Allison. You can set up a meeting with her to discuss it further if you would like.

### Overview: How It Works
The Flower Exercise is designed to help you move through 3 stages:

* The **brain dump** stage to organize your thoughts using these [worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing)
* The **synthesis** stage to summarize the findings in your brain dump
* The **prioritization** stage to narrow down what's most important to you from your synthesis. **The results from your prioritization stage are what should go on your finished Flower page.**

### You're Not a Role
Let's start by recapping the do's and don'ts of professional storytelling. When people have asked you what you do in the past, what have you said? “I was a construction worker.” “I was a marketing manager.” “I was a teacher.” Sound familiar? These kind of declarations are not inherently wrong -- it's important to claim your identity according to the work you love. 

However, stating your identity in this way can lock you into a role; but you’re not a role, you’re a person with many skills and many experiences.

Instead, try saying “I’m a person who…”

* "I’m a person who...is skilled at building things.”
* “I’m a person who...has experience in creating stories to attract customers.”
* “I’m a person who...knows how to explain concepts to others in smaller pieces.”

In this session, you’ll explore who you are from 7 different angles to discover what you want as you start looking for a job. **Because you are not just a software developer now, you are a person who has very specific skills, talents, experience, and goals that make you so much more than *just* a software developer.**

### The Seven Petals
I am a person who…has 7 sides to me:

1. Describe who you are in terms of what you know (favorite knowledges and/or fields of interest)
	* Examples: teaching, writing, providing services to others, etc.
2. Describe who you are in terms of the kinds of people you most prefer to work with and/or the kinds of people you would most like to serve
	* Examples:
		* Work with: Creative people; collaborative teams
		* Serve: People from a certain geographical area; people with certain needs, etc.
3. Describe who you are in terms of what you can do and what your favorite functional/transferable skills are
	* Examples: Project management skills; mentoring/teaching
4. Describe who you are in terms of your favorite working conditions
	* Examples: small company/large company/start-up; remote/in-person
5. Describe who you are in terms of your preferred salary and level of responsibility
	* Examples: working by yourself vs. member of a team vs. supervising others vs. running your own business
6. Describe who you are in terms of your preferred geographical location or surroundings
	* Examples: here or abroad; warm/cold, north/south, east/west, mountains/coast, urban/suburban/rural/rustic -- where would you be happiest, do your best work, and would most like to live?
7. Describe who you are in terms of your goals or sense of mission and purpose for your life. Or the goals/mission you want the organization to have where you decide to work

All 7 aspects are important for your job search; Why?

* If a job only matches 1 or 2 “petals,” it will not be fulfilling to you because it will only allow you to express one or two sides of yourself
* This picture is the most complete of you and defining these aspects will lead you to your dream job

#### Another Note: Pairin
Reminder that your Pairin survey results measured how you work, and from here, you can analyze a lot about what's important to you in your new career. Look at your results to think about:

1. Your Top General Style: how you like to work
2. Your Most Intense Driver: what motivates you the most
3. Your Highest EQ Competency: your mindsets and abilities
4. Your Leading Virtue Class: what you value

How do each of these categories help define your ideal career? 

### Tools
Complete [these worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing) to fulfill the brainstorming stages of the Flower Exercise

* Petal #1: Favorite Knowledges And/Or Fields of Interest
	* Goal: Summarize everything you know; Must have: knowledge from past experiences; Bonus: What you would like to learn
	* Tips: Knowledges are nouns
	* What You know from the past:
		* Go through everything you know; if you worked at Panera, this could mean you list “learned how to prepare and serve food, how to wait on customers, how to make change, how to deal with complaints, how to train new employees, etc.” Then go back and highlight the most important pieces to you -- which are you most satisfied with?
	* What you know outside of work:
		* What knowledge have you picked up outside of work?
		* Examples: Things learned in high school/college that you still value today; anything from training seminars, conferences, etc.; anything you learned at home or via the internet
	* What industries sound interesting to you:
Start broadly and then make more specific
	* Worksheet & Favorite Subjects Matrix
* Petal #2: Preferred Kinds of People to Work With
	* Background: People we work with either give us energy or drain our energy. They’re very important to how we work.
	* Goal: To avoid past bad experiences with people at work, focus on the people you most like to work with
	* Looking for:
		* Better picture in your mind of what kind of people surrounding you at work will enable you to operate at your highest and most effective level.
		* Better picture in your mind of what kind of people you would most like to serve or help: defined by age, problems, geography, etc.
		* Tips: These are descriptions -- adjectives
	* Party Game Exercise
		* Looking at the graphic for the party, answer these questions by writing down the letter:
			1. Which corner of the room would you be drawn to as the group of people you’d want to be around longest?
			2. 15 mins. Later, everyone in that corner leaves for another party, except you. Of the groups that remain, which group would you be drawn to now?
			3. 15 mins. Later, this group also leaves. Of the remaining groups, which do you join?

	* What is important to you?

### Choose Your Own Adventure: Work Time
Now start on the worksheets to think about each of these petals. Think about what's most important to you when it come to unpacking your approach to your job search. This is the brain dump part of the process: use the worksheets, reflect on your past experiences, journal about your passions. 

### Group Sharing
Find 3-4 people to share some takeaways from your brain dump. This is where you synthesize the information you've been working through by answering these questions:

* What did you discover about yourself and your ideal career in this exercise?
* Did anything surprise you?
* How will you use this information to drive your job search? 
* What do you still want to learn from this process?

### Final Reflection
From your group discussion, spend a few minutes prioritizing the most important takeaways and then fill out your Flower 1-pager with your most important priorities.

### Share Out & Closing
* What have you learned about yourself today?
* How will you apply this exercise to your job search? 

Remember that you can schedule a coaching session with Allison to talk through your discoveries to help you begin to narrow the scope of your job search.
