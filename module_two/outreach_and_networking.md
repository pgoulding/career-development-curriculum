### Deliverable
Provide a plan for how you'll start your outreach and networking this module using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_networking_guidelines.md).

### Opening Hook
What is networking?

You've done a few rounds of story sharing with each other at this point. What have you learned? Use Popcorn for 3-4 people to share what they've learned about someone else in the room (that person who's shared about will then share next). 

Share:
* Why do you remember this?
* What follow-up could you do with this person based on this knowledge?

### Intro to Outreach & Networking
**Networking** is learning about others and building relationships based on those connections -- which is why being able to tell your story is so important! **Outreach** is how you begin these relationships. 

There are different levels of networking and outreach. **Whole Group:** Why would you reach out to someone in the tech industry?

Here are some reasons:
1. To conduct research for your job search and get advice
2. To connect with someone who works at a company you're interested in and there's an open position there

Today, we are only going to talk about reason #1. In Module 3, we'll discuss strategies for reason #2. 

Our strategy for this is to define:

* The Why
* The Who
* The What

### The Why: Research
So, what do you want to learn?

* Start with your Flower Exercise findings
  * What are your goals? 
  * What transferable skills came up for you? 
  * What is your ideal work environment/culture?
  * What industries/fields are you most interested in?
  
* Try this [culture queries exercise](https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries)
  
* From here, think about how you can approach conducting research to focus your job search:
  * **I Do:** If I want to find out more about finding the kind of culture I want, I could start by narrowing down my own definition of culture (if I haven't already):
    * Learning & growth is encouraged (how?)
    * Collaborative environment (what is team workflow like? How is it actually collaborative?)
    * I can comfortably be myself (what do I want in order to do that?)

**We Do:**
* Using the examples above, what even more specific questions could we ask?
  * Brainstorm questions as a group

**You Do:** In your journal, brainstorm a list of topics/questions you want answers to in your research. 

**Pair & Share** with a partner to give feedback on specificity. 

### Networking
Who do you reach out to? How will you do it?

Your strategy for **who:**
* With the list of questions you want to ask, find someone who can best answer them
* Go to your current network (this is *warm* outreach) to see who fits this description

#### Your Network
Who is in your current network? 

* **Dormant Ties:** These are people you know from other walks of life whom you may not have talked with in a while
   * Why you should reach out to them: You already know them. You may not have talked to them in a while, but it's not a cold contact. And chances are, you're already connected to them on social media so it's not difficult to reconnect with them. 
    * What value they bring:
         * They can introduce you to others in their network. Look at their LinkedIn connections -- do they know people you want to know? 
    * What value you bring:
         * You can introduce them to people in the Turing network or talk to them about website design, the tech industry, any number of things that you have learned while at Turing
* **Weak Ties:** As opposed to strong ties (the people you are closest to), these are people who you are not as close with. They run in different circles than you do, so they know other people to introduce you to
    * Why you should reach out to them:
         * Open yourself up to new perspectives and relationships outside of your usual circle
    * What value they bring:
         * New people and new connections
    * What value you bring:
         * The same -- since you're a weak tie to them, you also have networks and information that is new to them. You're able to share this value equally. 
* **Turing Network:** 
   * Turing Mentors: If you don't already have a mentor you meet with regularly, you should find one right now. Use the [mentor database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxsATOSIdRZ78-Bj3GQY2LkIp0OV_sCN6GJVjtUuCl0/edit?usp=sharing). 
      * Why you should reach out to them:
         * This is *warm outreach* -- they are already in our community and have signed up specifically for students to reach out to them. What are you waiting for? 
      * What value they bring:
         * Project help
         * Drills and homework help
         * Learning about the industry
         * Technical and/or behavioral prep
         * Emotional support 
         * Learning about specific jobs/companies
         * Learning about the tech scene in a certain location
      * What value you bring:
         * Provide them with the opportunity to grow their mentoring skills
   * Turing Alumni (especially any who are not in the mentorship database):
      * Why you should reach out to them:
         * They've been in your shoes. They can give you the do's and don'ts of navigating the tech industry based on their own experience as a Turing grad.
      * What value they bring: 
         * In addition to their own perspective, they bring connections from the network they've been building since they were students. See who they can introduce you to.
      * What value you bring:
         * Community. You're part of the Turing community too and you serve as a connection to the latest information in the Turing community
         
For a more in-depth perspective on the network that you already have, check out Wharton professor and author of *Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success* Adam Grant's post [Finding the Hidden Value in Your Network](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uniBCEM9Wr8J:https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/finding-the-hidden-value-_1_b_3458536.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)

#### Expanding Your Circle
**Meetups/Events**:
* **Research.** As with outreach emails (see below), you'll want to conduct research on the organizers and anyone on the RSVP list ahead of time to get a sense of who you can connect with and why
* **Rethink Small Talk.** Most people don't feel comfortable with small talk, but this is how we break the ice in our conversations. Beyond asking people their names and what they think of the free pizza, how can you conduct small talk *with a purpose?* 

You've come prepared to share your story. How can you also learn about the other person's story in a way that makes them memorable? How can go from simply networking to creating a relationship? 

 Consider:

   * "What are you working on right now?" is a great question to lead with; allows person to answer in a way that speaks to their passions and not just describe their day-to-day
   * Discussing the topic of the event; what was interesting about the talk?
   * Current projects
   * The local tech scene 
   * Tell them about yourself -- this is a *great* time to practice that professional story!
        
* **Get a business card.** Find a way to follow up the conversation with this person and don't leave without a call to action -- how will you continue the conversation? 

**Social Networking:**
* Twitter follows/retweets/messages
* Connect on LinkedIn
  * Engage:
   * No one-off comments. Take the time to engage in the thread in a meaningful way 
* Blogging
* Open Source contributions:
  * Connect with people by showing off your skills
  * Check out [this guide for navigating open source and building a community!](https://opensource.guide/)

#### You Do: Who will you reach out to?
Spend 5 minutes brainstorming within your network who would be most beneficial to reach out to. Try to come up with more than 1 name although 1 contact is a great start!

#### Pair & Share
Pair with partner to share who will you reach out to and why. 

### Writing the Message
Once you decide who you'll reach out to, it's time to figure out your message. How? Again, start with research. 

Know who you're contacting:
* LinkedIn: Where have they worked?
* GitHub: What are they working on?
* Medium: What do they blog about?
* Twitter: What do they tweet about? 
* What else? 

#### Demo
Let's take 1-2 contacts and do some research as a group.

#### The Message
What should be included here?
    * Introduction: who are you?
    * Purpose: why are you reaching out?
    * Specifics to the contact: what do you know about them? How does it connect to your purpose?
    * Call to Action: what are the next steps here?

What should NOT be included here? (All from Alumni)
* Asking for a reference or job
* Unclear purpose
* Generic message/unclear specifics about them as a person. This includes using a template.
* Mentioning multiple people you're reaching out to

#### What Does This Look Like?
Let's craft a message to one of our contacts that we researched together. 

#### How to Send the Message: Email vs. LinkedIn
Whenever possible, find your contact's email (or use Slack if they're in the Turing network!). Why? Unless you're actively job searching or actively hiring, people may not be checking their LinkedIn regularly and might miss your message. Also, LinkedIn messages have a limited number of characters you can use. Instead try some of the following tools to find your contact's email:

* Tools for finding emails:
  * [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
  * [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
  * [Find That Email](https://findthat.email/)
  * [MatterMark](https://mattermark.com/)
  * [Skrapp.io](https://www.skrapp.io/)
  * [Quickmail.io](https://quickmail.io/)
  * [Snov.io](https://snov.io/)
  * [Go Pin Leads](https://www.gopinleads.com/)
  * GitHub
  * Personal website 

#### You Do
Craft your own message!

### Closing: Share Out & Takeaways
As we wrap up, share out:

* What are you working on next as you finalize your first outreach and networking plan?
* What will you include in a message to a contact?
* What questions do you still have?

Reminder about your deliverable due Friday of Week 5!
