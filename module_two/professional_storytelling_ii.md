### The Why/Hook
We've been focusing on building awareness of:

* Our strengths
* Our values
* Our identities
* Our passions
* Our goals in this career

Today, we'll take that information to craft a **compelling story** that describes who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community in order to find the right match for your future career.

From your professional story, we'll craft your resume, your Turing portfolio, update your LinkedIn, inspire others through blog posts, personal websites, projects, and more.   

### Elements of a Story
We are all inherent storytellers. Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? 

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published [this post](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) with her 22 rules for storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

**Turn & Talk:**

What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it's a story from childhood, maybe it's a book you just finished reading, or maybe it's a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.

**Whole Group Debrief:**

Sharing from 1-2 people:

* What key details do you remember from your partner's story?
* How did your partner tell the story? 
* What made the story interesting?

This brings us to the elements that make up a good story -- what are they?

Possible answers: consistent theme, protagonist who faces and overcomes challenges, a journey of some kind, sequential plot that shows a beginning, middle, and end.

When it comes to character, what does it mean to be the hero of the story? What are the typical characteristics of a hero? 

**More Lessons from Pixar (and Joseph Campbell):**
Most stories follow the 3-Act Arc:
* Act I (Set-Up)
   * Call to adventure and accepts
   * Rules of the world are established
   * Inciting Incident
* Act II (Struggle)
   * Looking for ways to solve the problem
   * Learning what it will take to actually solve problem
   * Crisis/“Lowest of the low”
* Act III (Finale)
   * Show what’s been learned
   * Protagonist is changed

**Connection to You:**
These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, the hero, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the narrative thread through your own theme.

**Disclaimer:** When we say story, this is not something that has been made up or embellished in any way. People can tell when you're not being truthful. Rather, this is about how to make a true account of a career trajectory engaging and inspiring. 

There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs:
* **Who are you?** *(as a developer, a teammate, a worker, a career changer)*
* **Why are you here?** *(Why software development? Why now? Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field)*
* **What's next?** *(Where do you see yourself going in this career?)* 

### What is a *Professional* Story?
Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you.

Your story is one of **transition.** These stories are inherently interesting as they have all the elements of a classic story, and most importantly, they have the important elements of change, conflict, and tension around the transition. Where are you going? What will happen next? It's so exciting for the listener! But it also depends on how you tell that story. Let's look at some examples... 

#### Story Examples: Which story is more compelling? 
During a networking event explored in this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/whats-your-story), senior managers who'd been downsized took turns telling what they had done before and what they were looking for next. Which of these stories is more interesting for you as a listener?

Story #1: "I started my career as a teacher, and after that, I went to grad school to get my MFA in creative writing. I did some work in publishing during grad school and also worked for an education nonprofit. After that, I moved to Denver and started working at an elementary school as the Director of School Operations. After I left the school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do next, but I received an email from Joanne at Turing about a new position. I thought it sounded like a great opportunity, so I interviewed and then started working at Turing. After this job, I think I'll look for something that combines education and coaching since that's what my job entails now."

Story #2: "I wasn't always sure what I wanted to do for a living, but one thing I do know is that I love to help people. This was the driving force behind my decision to join Teach for America after college. I enjoyed teaching because it allowed me to help my students and connect with them on a personal level, but I didn't enjoy the bureaucracy of working in K-12 education. This became really clear for me when I took a job as an administrator at an elementary school when I first moved to Denver. I had thought that because education had made up the bulk of my career, that this was the logical next step. But I wasn't happy, and it was clear that I needed a change. I wasn't sure what that change could be, but I decided to leave my job and take time to figure it out. During this time of self-discovery, I heard about Turing and realized that this could be an opportunity to combine my love for helping others and grow in my own understanding of what that meant. This opened me up to discovering professional coaching and apply that to assisting my students as they transition careers. I feel like I have a much more clear path now that also makes me happy and able to do what I love every day. I want to continue to impact the tech industry in a positive way by helping people from all walks of life utilize their potential and transition to this industry successfully." 

**Discuss:**

* What is the difference between these two stories? What elements do you see in each story?
* Which character did you care about more? Why?
* Based on these examples, what should your story *not* be?

The second story focuses more on the turning points -- the moments that cause your listener to ask, *"What happened next?"*

Now, let's apply these ideas to your own story and practice telling it. 

#### When & How You Tell Your Story
* Networking Events
* 1:1 Coffee Meetings
* Interviews

* How might your story be different in these different contexts?
* How will your 5-minute version of your story be different from your 1-minute elevator pitch?

### You Do: Individual Story-writing

**Write:** Reflect on your experience entering your new career in the software industry and write a draft of your story, answering the questions **who are you, why are you here, what's next?** Think about how others might root for you as a character and what's at stake for you in your career transition. Consider:

* Your Strengths: what makes you the "hero" of this story?
	* From StrengthsFinder, reflect on how developing your strengths at Turing has influenced your story
* How have you grown at Turing? What obstacles have you overcome? 
* What turning points led you to make this career change?
* What does your third act look like? How does transitioning to this career bring some closure to this narrative arc?
* Describe causality -- what made you want to make this career change? How is it grounded in your character?
* How you can create trust with the listener
* Creating coherence in your story
* Utilize a story form
* Tell multiple stories -- how can you adapt your story to different situations?

From what you wrote down, pull out 3 things that you want to memorize:
1. Important detail about your background
2. Important detail about your motives
3. Important detail about your career path

### Storytelling Practice & Feedback Groups
As you start to practice telling your story:
* Decide which scenario you’re in
  * “Tell me about yourself” or “Why should I hire you?”
* Pay attention to how you speak:
  * Word choice
  * Filler words (“um, uh, like”)
  * Clarity

Form groups of 3-4 people who you will share your story with. Each person will have approximately 2 minutes to share their story, and then your groupmates will provide you with 3 minutes of feedback. 

Feedback should include:
* **Appreciation** on what is compelling about the story
* **Coaching** on anything that isn't clear or about the partner's storytelling skills can be improved. 
* Principles of being specific, actionable, and kind 

### Closing
**Whole Group Debrief:** What takeaways do you have about what makes an effective professional story?

**Next Steps:**
Looking ahead at Module 3:
* Drafting your resume
* Creating your [Turing portfolio](https://alumni.turing.io)
* Consider how you can talk about yourself in networking settings, such as meetups, events, and job shadowing
