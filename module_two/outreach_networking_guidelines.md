# Outreach & Networking Plan
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking, so it's necessary to make a plan for what you'll try to further your networking. 

Identify a contact you will reach out to by the end of this module. This could be a mentor, alum, or anyone from your current network. Describe:

1. Why you want to connect with this person and what you want to talk about

Frank Valcarcel from CuttleSoft, I met him a few times before, he's the CEO of a small web dev company, I want to talk to him about how he started off and what he would recommend to start off in this field to become a CEO.

2. When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet

I'll contact him by the end of the Mod and buy him a beer.

3. What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them

Hard to say, I'd like to find out what he suggests before formulating a plan on what we are going to talk about.

4. What other steps will you take to start building a stronger network in the tech community?

I started a blog on Medium, and Dev.to, becoming more active on Twitter, and started making my own site. I also volunteered to work DinosaurJS over the mod break, and joined some Dev Meetup groups.
